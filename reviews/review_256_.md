# Review 256

## Interest of content

- Each of the pages on the site both have lots of detailed information about their respective areas. 
- The index page would be better if it included some generic information about the topic and gave information about the website.

## Consistency and quality of visual presentation

- All of the pages on the site have a consistent visual theme with the header being indentical on all pages. 
- The text and header styles are also the same across all their pages since they decided to use a single styles.css file across the site.
- One improvement in this area could be the colour choice for the main web page title.

## Quality of written presentation

- The text is presented clearly using headings.
- They have also decded to use a nice font with justified text to make it easier to read.
- An improvement here could be having two columns or increasing the size of the margins for wider screens so it is easier to read.

## Validity of HTML

- Most of the HTML is fully valid and the website renders perfexcly with no visual problems.
- When looking at the source code, a standard indentation length is used and followed well.
- The scripts.js file is also corrextly linked at the bottom of DigitalHomes.html.
- In HealthCare.html, some \<p> tags have numbers inside of them which are unnecessary. 
- There is also an extra \</paragraph> closing tag on line 110 which is not needed


## Evidence of collaboration

- In DigitalHomes.html, CaitlinHorton originally wrote most of the file. It was later modified by Acier-Inox to fix some of the p tags which had numbers in.
